  Cymbols has built-in source parsers. It parses source code into symbols and creates the source outline.

#### Context Parse
Cymbols analyze the source context when you navigate codes. Source context may generally be a function, variable, or custom data definition. If a definition is duplicated, Cymbols will list them as a table and let you make a selection.

#### Source Navigate
If a source file is parsed, you can go to the declaration or definition of a symbol with the command shortcut "CMD + Click."  If the declaration or definition is duplicated, they are listed as a table and let you make a selection.

#### Source Edit
An editor is contained in Cymbols. It supports syntax highlight and nested split layout; a befitting layout may speed up your code review.

#### Reference Search
Reference Search is another critical function in Cymbols. When a project is built, right-click a symbol and select the "Search Reference..." item in the popup menu; all references from the emblem will be listed, and clicking an item will jump to the reference.

#### Multiple UI Themes
Cymbols's style look can be customized. By default, we provide 2 UI Themes, "Cymbols" and "Monokai." You can create your own style to make a new look.
